This application runs a certain program you specify, and after a certain amount of time (which you can set) it kills it and restarts it.
If you press enter in terminal window where Timed Killer-Runner runs, you reset the timer.

-killname					- manually specify the processes to be killed, one by one, separated by spaces. Note that the list needs to be terminated by 0;
